## Software Testing Course 5 ECTS
<p>This folder contains three assignments in the Software technology course at my university. This course focused on the analytical school of thought in testing, including unit testing and different coverage metrics. The third assignment included a brief introduction to Robot Framework.</p>

### Assignment 1 - Mutant Testing and Code Coverage
<p>In this assignment, we explored fundamental concepts of code coverage, mutation testing, and flowcharts. Based on this, I formulated test requirements using both node and edge coverage, as well as predicates and their reachability conditions.</p>

### Assignment 2 - Mutant Testing and Mockito

<p>In this assignment, I performed integration testing at the method level, focusing on aspects such as method calls and return values. This included analyzing all-coupling definitions, DU-pairs, and last-def first-use relationships.</p>

### Assignment 3 - Robot Framework

<p>The third part focused on logic coverage and predicates. I enumerated tests using Boundary Value Analysis (BVA), and input spaces were modeled using Input Space Partitioning (ISP).</p>
